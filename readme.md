# WOLF - Windows Operations & Library of Functions C\# 

My very first program that morphed into a Frakenstein mess! I am rewriting significant portions of this source code.

December 30th, 2016
Beginning a refactoring of code. Employing some C# 6.0 language simplifcations and general cleanup. Improving performance across the board.


# NOTE ABOUT ANTI-VIRUS / VIRUSTOTAL

Identified the function name tripping anti-virus software "DisableWindowsKeyLogging" and KeyLogging bool variables have simply been renamed.
VirusTotal 100% clean again.

This program now comes up either 100% clean or one false positive on VirusTotal.
